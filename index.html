        This game is built on bleeding edge web development technology. There is some setup involved if you're on an older sytem:
        <ul>
          <li>THE ESSENTIAL FACTOR IS ENABLING WEBGL. Currently this is found in newer versions of Chrome and Mozilla, but you may still have to enable it. You can do this by typing "chrome://flags" (without the quotes in your web browser URL. Don't get intimidated. Simply search for the selection that allows you to enable WebGl. You may also need to enable the experimental system's worker option, if WebGL isn't enough.</li>
          <li>Currently working on switching Multiplayer from running off of WEBRTC workers. Instead have it run along side a NODEJS server with integration into Facebooks API system so you can shoot your friends! It's coming. I'll figure it out.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <a href="list.html" id="play-button">LOCK AND LOAD!</a>
      </div>
      <div class="section" id="about">
        <div class="title">What...you made a video game?</div>
        <p>Nope. Can't take all the credit. WebGL use case has been around for a couple years now. However, we have finally reahed a point where Browsers are natively integrating more and more with GPU's (your graphics cards). Graphics cards are more powerful than they have ever been, and cheaper than they have ever been as well. It's the perfect storm for WebGL to move to the forefront in Web Development. This completely transforms dynamic design and development. While still in its infancy, I am more than confident over the next year this kind of tech is going to explode.</p>
<div class="middle-bg">
        <p>This game is unique in that its completely in browser. Not impressed? You're right, Java has been doing this for a long time. Python can create these environments as well. However, the big bugaboo with the other guys it 1.) Security: 90% of the malware you have on your inferior PC right now is from accidently downloading Java droplets. Way to easy to hack. 2.) These kind of games generally require a Client and a Server to play. An example would be your xbox, which acts as a Client, connects to a video games server in order to function. I didn't want to make you guys download anything. Refer back to point numero uno. This is solely written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The EXACT same components you find in Facebook, Tumblr, Youtube, JoesBlogs, EVERYWHERE. I find it absolutley remorkable. This version is still buggy, but I will continue to work on it. As the knowledge base grows on this technology, so will the game.</p>
        <p>NOTE: I AM LOOKING FOR A DESIGNER OR ANOTHER DEVELOPER TO HELP WITH THE PROJECT. SHOOT ME AN EMAIL AT <a href="mailto:branden@danetheory.com">
Branden@DaneTheory.com</a> I'm not a code nazi. If this looks cool to you and you even just want to learn, go ahead and email me. We can learn together! For those with Design experience, Photoshop would be a big plus. Any experience with Cinema4D, Maya, AutoDesk, or 3DS is also huge. If you have Unity expeireince, we just became best friends. If you are a Developer with a strong working knowledge of Javascript and the prominent game engines out there (Three.js, Physics.js) shoot me a message. Experience with NodeJs isn't a must, but I could really use someone other than myself who understands asynchronous Javascript. Getting this to work in a multiplayer environment via Facebook friends? Candy Crush can suck it.</p>

        <p>THINGS STILL TODO:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Refine code to avoid any browser hacks</li>
          <li>Finish the new character skins (characters in next lauch will include Master Chief, The Kool-Aid man, Bill Clinton, and Wolverine)</li>
          <li>Finish recreating the map "Longest" from Halo 1 as the main battle Map. NOTE: IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE A DIFFERENT MAP, LET ME KNOW.</li>
          <li>Add in Easter Eggs and Cheat Codes (Star power, Super Smash Bros. Hammer, anything that would be ridiculous)</li>
          <li>Guns from classic games AND newer games! Seriously! I'm working on integrating the Portal Gun. Physics are pretty wild. What guns/weaponry would you like to see?</li>
          <li>Multiplayer via secure NodeJS. Facebook integration so you can shoot your friends</li>
          <li>Accomplishing the above would mean integrating in game voice chat and even webcam access would not be too far behind! Very cool.</li>
          <li>FAQ with greater details for gamers and coders alike coming soon!</li>
